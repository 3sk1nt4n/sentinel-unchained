# Final sprint - roadmap to the deadline

> **Deadline: Monday 2026-07-21, 17:00 PT.** This is the execution roadmap
> distilled from the [adversarial judge-panel review](JUDGE-PANEL-REVIEW.md),
> ordered strictly by leverage. Do the phases in order; do not polish P2 items
> while a P0 item is open.

## P0 - existence gates (nothing else matters until these are done)

### 1. One authentic COMPLETE GPT-5.6 Sol run - ~4 h including retries

The single highest-leverage act for every criterion. Known risk: typed-DONE-v2
has never succeeded live (seven PARTIAL attempts retained on 2026-07-19), so:

- [ ] Dry-run the full lifecycle on a small harmless case first (opening →
      adaptive → typed DONE → serializer → reviewer → report → verify).
- [ ] Then the real case under submission caps. Budget 2–3 attempts
      (~$0.50–2 per attempt under CAUTIOUS ceilings).
- [ ] Retain everything; disclose every valid attempt (honesty rails).
- [ ] Gate: `sentinel verify <bundle> --require-complete --require-live-gpt56`
      passes, and `scripts/check_viewer.py` passes on the same bundle.

### 2. The sub-3-minute public YouTube video - ~3 h

The only DQ-level gap. Record against the authentic bundle from step 1.
Storyboard exists in [DEMO-SCRIPT.md](DEMO-SCRIPT.md); add the panel's killer
beat for the Idea criterion:

- [ ] Open on the thesis line, then the colorful onboarding and launch phrase.
- [ ] Live run: opening book, six typed tools with bytes/timing, status badge.
- [ ] **The 20-second proof moment: flip one byte in the sealed bundle and show
      the verifier fail, then restore and show VALID.**
- [ ] Audio names Codex and GPT-5.6 explicitly; Codex Session ID on screen.
- [ ] Under 3:00, public visibility, link committed into README + SUBMISSION.

## P1 - make the work visible (~4 h total)

### 3. Ship a judge-verifiable proof bundle - ~2 h
- [ ] Commit a sanitized COMPLETE bundle (viewer.html + receipts) under
      `docs/runs/` or a GitHub release, or host viewer.html via Pages.
- [ ] Link it in the README first screen: "See a proof bundle right now - no install."
- [ ] Replace the literal `<COMPLETE_BUNDLE>` placeholder in SUBMISSION.md.

### 4. Three visuals at the top of the README - ~2 h
- [x] Real onboarding welcome rendered to SVG from captured ANSI output
      (`docs/assets/cli-welcome.svg`).
- [x] Real case card (honest amber `ACTION NEEDED` on the synthetic fixture)
      rendered to SVG (`docs/assets/cli-case-card.svg`).
- [ ] Screenshot: viewer.html findings/citations view - **gated on the
      COMPLETE bundle**; add when P0.1 lands.
- [x] Status tables moved below the Quickstart; the first screen now shows the
      thesis bullets, the real product screen, and the judge tables.

## P2 - point defense (~2 h total, only after P0+P1)

- [x] "Why not just guardrails, evals, or attestation?" section added to the
      README with the named prior-art families and the one-sentence delta.
- [x] Instant native no-key lane promoted above the `docker compose build`
      lane in JUDGE-QUICKSTART, with honest timing labels.
- [x] demo.ps1 finale reframed: "DEMO PASSED: fail-closed run sealed a
      verifiable proof bundle" (semantics and compatibility marker unchanged).
- [x] "Who needs this" scenario added to the README.
- [x] Reviewer mechanism named ("monotonic review lattice") in the README - 
      still to be said aloud in the video.

## Submission gates - Monday morning, not Monday afternoon

- [ ] Incognito QA: repo, video, hosted viewer all load logged-out.
- [ ] Devpost form filled from [SUBMISSION.md](SUBMISSION.md); canonical URL is
      `github.com/3sk1nt4n/Unchained` (renamed 2026-07-19).
- [ ] Codex Session ID double-checked on the form and in the README.
- [ ] Final tag pushed; commit/tag/image identity agree.
- [ ] Devpost confirmation screenshot retained.

## Cut list (already decided - do not reopen)

- Same-evidence competitive benchmark: **cut.** The claims ledger already marks the
  comparison PENDING; a half-shipped benchmark reads worse than none.
- GHCR prebuilt image: nice-to-have, only if all gates above are green.
- Any further documentation polish: past the point of diminishing returns.

## Honesty rails (unchanged, never cross)

No fake or replayed COMPLETE run. Disclose every valid attempt. No
"faster than a competitor," no "independent evaluation," no completed-investigation
claims until each is true. Every published metric carries its numerator,
denominator, and source artifact.
