# OpenAI-native vNext release handoff

This is the comprehensive engineering, Docker, product, demo, benchmark, and
hackathon handoff for Unchained's OpenAI-native vNext. It is the
canonical long-form companion to the judge-first [README](../README.md) and the
living [hackathon handover](../HACKATHON_HANDOVER.md).

## 1. Release identity and provenance

### Published vNext foundation

The exact foundation commit is visible at
[`ed4d3f5`](https://github.com/3sk1nt4n/Unchained/commit/ed4d3f540a27171c04a7321f4f85efea23d905de).
The default repository page now follows `main`; release-facing follow-ups must
land there so judges do not have to discover a side branch.

### Docker and user-experience follow-up

The follow-up containing this document adds:

- a judge-first README and new branded hero;
- a one-request GPT-5.6 Luna typed-tool canary;
- `OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE` support for mounted secrets;
- a multi-stage Linux/AMD64 Docker build and full test target;
- a hardened offline Compose service and opt-in live-smoke service;
- a committed non-sensitive synthetic profile fixture;
- synchronized handoff, scope, and Docker disclosure.

The controlling follow-up identity is always the Git commit containing this
document (`git rev-parse HEAD`) and the matching public `main`. Do not substitute
an uncommitted container image for a release identity.

## 2. Validation gates

### Foundation gate

The published foundation passed the following under CPython 3.11.9:

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Full offline suite | 267/267 passed |
| Focused verifier/evidence/tool review | 124/124 passed |
| Ruff lint and formatting | Passed |
| Dependency integrity | `pip check` clean |
| Wheel and source distribution | Built; wheel also built from the sdist path |
| Git whitespace | Passed |
| CLI help | Passed |
| `sentinel doctor --json` without key | Expected exit `2`; no secret printed |
| Secret/private-key scan | Passed |
| Independent final P0/P1 review | No remaining release blocker found |

At that point the reviewed implementation contained 17 source modules, 32
Python files across source and tests, 13,383 physical source lines, 12,259
nonblank source lines, and 267 passing tests.

### Docker and UX follow-up gate

The current follow-up was tested on Docker Engine 29.5.3, Linux/AMD64, through
Docker Desktop/WSL2 with Compose v5.1.4:

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Multi-stage `test` image | Passed |
| Linux CPython | 3.11.9 |
| Full suite inside the image | 274 tests passed |
| Ruff lint | Passed |
| Ruff format check | 49 Python files formatted |
| `pip check` | Clean |
| Minimal runtime build | Passed |
| Runtime size at pre-publication test | 129,150,798 bytes |
| Runtime user | `10001:10001`, non-root |
| Entrypoint | `/usr/bin/tini -- sentinel` |
| Runtime Git | Absent; Git is builder-only |
| Offline help | Passed and lists `smoke-openai` |
| No-key doctor | Expected exit `2`; Python/dependencies ready; no secret printed |
| Synthetic profile | `logs-only`, `E001`, zero OpenAI calls |
| Synthetic pre/post custody | Match |
| Offline service network | `network_mode: none` |
| Root filesystem/evidence | Read-only |
| Linux capabilities | All dropped |
| `no-new-privileges` | Enabled |
| Image environment/history credential scan | Passed |

At the time of this Docker follow-up, no authorized `OPENAI_API_KEY` was
present, so the real Luna request was not sent in that session. That historical
gap was subsequently narrowed by the independently reviewed live receipt below.

Current reviewed implementation size after the follow-up: 17 source modules,
13,591 physical source lines, 12,448 nonblank source lines, 32 Python files
across source and tests, and 274 passing tests. The judge-first README is 395
lines; this canonical comprehensive handoff is intentionally longer.

### First live receipt gate (2026-07-19)

A project-affiliated second reviewer tested commit
`51662cfb809212af3b58a680c0d9265d91692302` on the owner's Windows 11 / CPython
3.11 environment and supplied `REPORT-LIVE-RUN.md`. Its exact SHA-256 is
`7ebdf230de88b18af3cd8a38acecebc2b1b48ca0d6c0740e596dd0bb0df53c9c`.

The Luna canary was reported live with one `gpt-5.6-luna` request, one valid
strict typed call, no evidence read, 186 input tokens, 27 output tokens, and 213
total tokens. No raw Luna JSON receipt accompanied the review. The committed
[Luna projection](runs/luna-canary-receipt.json) is therefore labeled
second-reviewer-attested (project-affiliated), nonqualifying, and not
cryptographically bound to a raw provider response.

The retained Sol bundle is stronger evidence because its own summary, audit,
profile, manifest, and detached checksum are available. Values below come from
those artifacts - not rounded reviewer prose where they differ:

| Sol capped-run fact | Bundle-derived value |
|---|---|
| Run | `20260719T020118Z-ede6c445` |
| Terminal | `PARTIAL`, exit `3`, `MAX_TOOL_CALLS` |
| Evidence | One ready Windows memory item, `E001`, 2,147,483,648 bytes |
| Requested / recorded provider model | `gpt-5.6` / `gpt-5.6-sol` on both responses |
| Opening | 6 selected, 6 executed successfully, 0 rejected |
| Opening tools | `vol_pstree`, `vol_psscan`, `vol_netscan`, `vol_malfind`, `vol_cmdline`, `vol_svcscan` |
| Adaptive request | `vol_dlllist`; reservation cap-blocked before forensic execution |
| Usage | 58,508 input, 746 output, 59,254 provider-total tokens |
| Local cost estimate | `$0.38789875`; provider-billed cost absent |
| End-to-end wall time | 43,702 ms |
| Custody | Baseline and final check recorded; SHA-256 matched; mount released |
| Offline verification | `VALID`, 13 artifacts, 38 chained audit entries, terminal still `PARTIAL` |

The sanitized [Sol receipt](runs/sol-capped-dc01-opening.json) binds that
projection to these locally retained source artifacts:

| Source artifact | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `audit.jsonl` | `57b3413e5d2c63ce18a3ffc83b70af4f22889b5ea2cdf37fbb5d0984c4774b84` |
| `manifest.json` | `be6ff8b13099cffcd1ca0e2b69c53f106c7b7b3f64b5ad7f628522fb0f59bb3d` |
| `profile.json` | `15dc2ee77de1cb10a5569ed66a0f81048f23782d045eaeaccd6fe88ff7d28d46` |
| `summary.json` | `89b069bb4fdfe2af0a4f98df775492a6a2eb8a7e7bbe8364c91015aead8f9846` |

This closes the live Luna-connectivity and Sol-opening/tool-path gaps. It does
**not** close the complete-case gap. The six-call cap fired before any terminal
action, structured findings, fresh downgrade-only review, and the complete
report lifecycle. That retained run used literal-DONE-v1; the subsequent
typed-DONE-v2 hardening is verified offline but not yet demonstrated live.
Offline verification also authenticates neither OpenAI nor
semantic forensic truth, and because original evidence is excluded from the
bundle it checks recorded custody receipts rather than rehashing that evidence.

## 3. Completed engineering jobs

### 1. Reviewed both starting points

The work established exact baselines for
[Sentinel Ensemble Qwen](https://github.com/3sk1nt4n/Sentinel-Ensemble-Qwen)
and Unchained before changing architecture. The untouched Unchained
baseline passed 129 tests, Ruff, dependency checks, and package builds. The
detailed defect and design disposition is in
[OPENAI_VNEXT_REVIEW.md](OPENAI_VNEXT_REVIEW.md).

### 2. Built a deterministic evidence front door

Before any model call, code enumerates regular files, rejects unsafe discovery
conditions, hashes every input, classifies bounded content probes, derives
OS/evidence shape/filesystems/readiness/symbols/tool families, assigns stable
public IDs such as `E001`, withholds local paths from the model-visible profile,
and emits an honest capability label.

The verifier independently recalculates route shape, OS reconciliation,
filesystem values, and conflict warnings. Post-run custody rehashes the complete
set and fails closed on identity, size, timestamp, content, membership, mount
release, or digest changes.

### 3. Corrected the custody namespace

Initial and final custody now use the same public evidence-ID namespace. Every
eligible tool receives controller-owned `(evidence_id, sha256)` references, and
the verifier binds those references through request, start, execution,
completion, retained output, finding span, review citation, and report.

### 4. Made multi-image behavior honest

The current scheduler supports at most one ready memory image and one ready disk
image per case. Two same-class ready images now fail closed with a split-case
instruction rather than silently analyzing the first while implying case-wide
coverage.

### 5. Implemented the GPT-5.6 opening book

GPT-5.6 chooses one to six currently available typed tools. Code requires unique
call IDs and names, closed schemas, valid JSON, exact argument keys and JSON
types, and the route-specific allowlist. Any unknown, duplicate, malformed,
over-limit, or mistyped call rejects the whole opening; no valid-looking subset
executes.

### 6. Made the opening genuinely parallel

Code reserves all opening slots atomically and then runs the validated batch
concurrently. Regression tests prove separate calls reach a synchronization
barrier before either finishes. Reservation failure starts no executor and
forces a non-complete result.

### 7. Replaced transcript replay with stateless packets

Each adaptive turn receives a bounded packet containing the canonical profile,
visible case ledger, deterministic receipt index, budget snapshot, latest
observation IDs, and only the matching bounded observations. It does not replay
the full response transcript or opaque reasoning objects. Every nonterminal
turn supplies a visible UTF-8 ledger update capped at 8,192 bytes.

### 8. Enforced one adaptive typed action per turn

After the parallel opening, each adaptive response must request exactly one
typed action: one eligible forensic tool or the canonical non-forensic finish
action. This makes each state change inspectable:

```text
PLAN -> one ACT -> OBSERVE -> visible UPDATE -> next bounded turn
```

### 9. Replaced brittle text termination with typed `DONE` v2

Four unscored live attempts exposed the actual v1 failure mode. Their retained
audit records contain completed terminal responses with 395–1,750 characters
of visible ledger text but no function call; they were not empty responses.
The literal-DONE-v1 controller correctly refused to reinterpret that prose as
completion, but the provider/model pairing did not reliably emit the raw token.

The v2 runtime now gives every adaptive request the immutable forensic catalog
plus exactly one closed protocol action:

```text
finish_investigation({"status":"DONE"})
```

`tool_choice=required` and `max_tool_calls=1` require exactly one typed action.
Code accepts the finish action only with valid strict arguments equal to the
single key/value above. Empty text, whitespace, case variants, punctuation,
Markdown, and narrative prose never gain terminal authority. Historical
literal-DONE-v1 bundles remain verifier-readable, but the new runtime emits and
the verifier binds `typed-DONE-v2`.

### 10. Forced structured investigation serialization

After typed `DONE`, a separate mandatory structured call serializes status,
case notes, findings, proposed statuses, severity, cited tool calls, supporting
quotes, IOCs, limitations, and unresolved questions. GPT-5.6 cannot finish with
an arbitrary Markdown report.

### 11. Added exact content-addressed evidence spans

Each accepted quote becomes an evidence span containing a stable span ID, tool
call ID, full artifact SHA-256, UTF-8 byte start/end, exact text, and occurrence
count across the complete output. The verifier reopens the retained artifact,
checks its identity/digest, reads the exact bytes, compares text, recounts
occurrences, and checks the finding/tool relation. Coverage includes a valid
supporting quote after byte 3,000.

### 12. Added a fresh downgrade-only reviewer

A new GPT-5.6 request sees only verified controller state, not investigator
reasoning history. It may preserve or downgrade an existing finding. It cannot
upgrade, create IDs, cite unrelated receipts, quote outside accepted spans,
omit rationale, or silently remove its result. This is a monotonic review
lattice, not a claim of external ground truth.

### 13. Replaced free-form report authority

GPT-5.6 submits a bounded structured report draft. Deterministic code owns the
authoritative finding table, status transitions, span/tool references, IOCs,
limitations, unresolved questions, status, and safe Markdown structure.
Model-authored prose is labeled nonauthoritative.

### 14. Added exact deterministic report proof

Strict verification reconstructs `report.md` from verified profile,
investigation, spans, reviewer verdicts, and structured draft, then requires
byte-for-byte equality. Rewriting the report and recomputing manifest hashes is
not enough to pass.

### 15. Added a static proof viewer

Every finalized bundle contains deterministic `viewer.html`: no JavaScript,
external fonts/images/frames/resources, live links, or network requests;
dynamic content is escaped; a restrictive CSP is embedded. It presents
inventory, custody, findings, transitions, receipts, citations, and limitations
without a server or rebuild.

### 16. Added an independent positive viewer policy

The verifier independently rejects scripts, frames, images, objects, forms,
active media/CSS, external URLs, event handlers, unexpected elements or
attributes, altered CSP, and malformed structure. It also rerenders the viewer
from verified state and requires exact bytes.

The new network-free `scripts/check_viewer.py` first verifies a bundle, reapplies
that positive policy, and confirms the six judge-facing sections. Against the
retained capped Sol bundle it passed with 13 verified artifacts, 38 chained
audit entries, all six sections, no server/network requirement, and the honest
recorded-custody warning. Because that bundle is `PARTIAL`, this is not the
pending `COMPLETE` findings/transition/citation rendering gate. Manual
Chrome/Edge and Firefox checks at desktop and narrow widths also remain pending.

### 17. Made `sentinel view` verification-gated

`sentinel view <bundle>` verifies before opening. A bundle claiming `COMPLETE`
automatically receives complete strict lifecycle verification even if the user
omitted strict flags.

### 18. Expanded the verifier into a protocol checker

The verifier reconstructs canonical profile/route/custody, configured caps,
exact opening and adaptive inputs, ledger, receipt index, budgets, observations,
model views, serializer/reviewer/report inputs, typed schemas/arguments,
response/request identity, phase options, output ceilings, retry eligibility and
timeouts, code-owned cost estimates, cumulative usage, lifecycle counts,
report/viewer bytes, final custody, and terminal status.

`COMPLETE` cannot contain capped or rejected receipts. Output usage cannot exceed
the paired request maximum. Retry reasons/timeouts and lifecycle counts bind the
actual audited collections.

### 19. Removed duplicate raw-response authority

Provider output items are used internally by the adapter but are not retained in
the audit as a competing proof representation. The audit authority is the
normalized message, validated function calls, model/request/response identity,
status, and normalized usage.

### 20. Added bounded, audited retry behavior

SDK implicit retries remain disabled. Controller code allows at most two
transient retries for connection/timeout failures and HTTP 408/409/429/5xx,
with audited failure, eligibility, delay, timeout, recovery, skipped, and
terminal events. A model dispatch may retry; a forensic action is never repeated
because a model dispatch retried.

### 21. Added request/output budget parity

Every provider response is audited and charged before controller use. A response
reporting output above the request's actual bounded maximum is still recorded
and charged, then rejected. Equality at the ceiling remains valid.

### 22. Added reproducible local Sol cost accounting

The proof path uses a code-owned GPT-5.6 Sol price table. The verifier recomputes
per-call and cumulative estimated cost, token counters, final model usage, and
terminal budget. Price-looking environment variables cannot zero the estimate.
The result is a deterministic cap estimate, not an OpenAI invoice.

### 23. Added explicit phase policies

| Phase | Reasoning | Verbosity | Preferred output maximum | Minimum allocation | Typed-call ceiling |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Opening | Low | Low | 2,048 | 1 | 6 |
| Adaptive investigation | Medium | Low | 4,096 | 4,096 | 1 required action |
| Investigation serialization | Medium | Low | 12,288 | 4,096 | 1 |
| Fresh reviewer | High | Low | 12,288 | 4,096 | 1 |
| Report draft | Low | Medium | 8,192 | 1 | 1 |

Budget preflight may reduce a preferred maximum only to the phase minimum. If
the remaining token or estimated-cost budget cannot preserve that allocation,
the corresponding cap fires before provider dispatch. Because the API maximum
includes both reasoning and visible output, this is an allocation guard - not a
promise of visible-token volume. Requests use `store=false`, no prior response
ID, bounded current-turn inputs, implicit caching, and code-owned caps.

### 24. Hardened the private tool-worker boundary

Production reference tools run in fixed private child processes with a fixed
module entrypoint, Python safe-path mode, no shell, allowlisted operations and
executables, bounded JSON I/O, wall time, process-tree ownership, Windows Job
Object or POSIX process-group termination, credential/proxy/agent scrubbing,
path replacement, and deterministic output retention.

The complete accepted output is content-addressed. The model receives at most
65,536 UTF-8 bytes plus an explicit receipt describing complete bytes/digest,
selected prefix, rule, and truncation state.

### 25. Added a user-facing CLI and container preflight

The lifecycle is:

```text
sentinel doctor
sentinel profile <evidence> --json
sentinel smoke-openai --json
sentinel run <evidence> --caps strict
sentinel verify <bundle> --require-complete --require-live-gpt56
sentinel view <bundle>
```

Readiness is checked before evidence I/O, secrets are never printed, progress is
phase-oriented, exit codes are stable, split-case errors are actionable, and
the final CLI prints exact next commands. Docker adds an offline/no-network
profile and a separate secret-mounted Luna canary without weakening the Sol
proof path.

## 4. Architecture and authority boundary

### GPT-5.6 authority

- choose bounded investigative strategy;
- update the visible case ledger;
- choose one adaptive typed action;
- serialize proposed findings;
- perform fresh preserve-or-downgrade review;
- draft bounded nonauthoritative narrative.

### Deterministic code authority

- classify and route evidence;
- hash and recheck custody;
- expose eligible tools and schemas;
- validate names, JSON, types, references, and caps;
- execute fixed tools and retain full outputs;
- resolve exact evidence spans;
- constrain verdict transitions;
- render authoritative report/viewer;
- seal and independently verify the bundle.

## 5. Comparison: baseline, Sentinel-Ensemble, and vNext

| Area | Reviewed Unchained baseline | Sentinel-Ensemble direction | OpenAI-native vNext |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary value | Strong deterministic/native substrate | Broad forensic catalog and ensemble reference | Bounded autonomy plus independently checkable proof |
| Strategy | Adaptive model loop | Multiple model/ensemble roles | Parallel opening plus one-action stateless loop |
| Opening | Less complete proof binding | Ensemble orchestration | 1–6 all-or-none typed calls, actually concurrent |
| Context | Growing transcript/tool replay | More orchestration context | Compact stateless packets + latest observations |
| Later actions | Weaker transition binding | Broader multi-role exchange | Exactly one typed adaptive action per turn |
| Termination | Less exact boundary | Ensemble completion behavior | Required closed `finish_investigation({"status":"DONE"})` action; text has no terminal authority |
| Grounding | Model-supplied references | Model-centered synthesis | Code-resolved full-artifact UTF-8 spans |
| Reviewer | Weaker monotonic proof | Reviewer roles | Fresh context, preserve or downgrade only |
| Report | Free-form Markdown influential | Model-authored synthesis | Structured draft; code owns rows/citations/status |
| Custody | Initial/final namespace mismatch | Not the ensemble's central strength | Canonical public IDs from prehash through posthash |
| Tool binding | Evidence input partly out-of-band | Broad typed catalog | Every receipt binds evidence ID + initial digest |
| Large output | Legitimate netscan could exceed old ceiling | Provider delivery less explicit | Full retention + explicit bounded model-view receipt |
| Proof | Hash chain/artifacts, incomplete lifecycle binding | Not an independent proof protocol | Exact packet, receipt, span, cost, report, viewer, custody reconstruction |
| UX | Runner/developer oriented | Guided but large ensemble surface | Judge-first README + doctor/profile/run/verify/view + static viewer |
| Performance thesis | Growing context/sequential behavior | Extra ensemble calls/context | Six-way opening, stateless turns, phase budgets, implicit cache |
| Honest limitation | Needed stronger boundaries | Breadth could outrun proof | Explicitly separates consistency, authenticity, and semantic truth |

Sentinel-Ensemble remains valuable as the commit-pinned typed forensic-tool reference and a
demonstration of breadth. vNext wins on a thinner, more legible model layer,
smaller proof surface, exact grounding, and a judge experience that can be
explained in one breath.

## 6. Why this can win

### The memorable thesis

> Unchained turns GPT-5.6 into a bounded forensic strategist while deterministic
> code preserves evidence authority, and every completed investigation produces
> a content-addressed proof bundle that can be independently checked offline.

Do not pitch “another LLM connected to forensic tools.” Pitch the separation of
strategy from authority.

### Why judges can understand it quickly

```text
GPT-5.6 chooses what to inspect.
Code decides what is legal.
Tools produce retained evidence.
GPT-5.6 proposes conclusions.
A fresh reviewer can only preserve or reduce them.
Code renders and verifies the proof.
```

This is easier to defend than several free-form agents reviewing one another.
It also highlights what the model is **not** allowed to do.

### Why it is designed to be faster

1. Up to six high-value opening tools run concurrently.
2. There is no ensemble conversation before each forensic action.
3. Adaptive requests do not replay accumulated provider history.
4. Only current controller state and latest observations are resent.
5. Phase-specific reasoning/output policies avoid uniform over-spending.
6. Stable prefixes support implicit prompt caching.
7. Hashing, routing, validation, span resolution, report rows, and proof
   construction consume no model tokens.
8. Hard call/token/cost/wall caps prevent runaway work.

This is a performance thesis, not a measured result. “Faster than Sentinel-Ensemble” becomes
allowed language only after the frozen same-evidence benchmark.

### Why it is more defensible

```text
finding
  -> cited tool call
  -> verified receipt
  -> content-addressed full output
  -> exact UTF-8 byte range
  -> exact quote
  -> fresh downgrade-only verdict
  -> deterministic report row
```

If a link is absent, altered, unrelated, outside retained output, or unsupported,
strict verification fails.

### Why it is friendlier

The operator needs five verbs: `doctor`, `profile`, `run`, `verify`, and `view`.
The README gives three risk/cost lanes. The judge can inspect a retained bundle
without Python, an API key, evidence, a forensic workstation, or a running
server. The static viewer presents what happened while the verifier establishes
whether the bundle is internally consistent.

### Why honest limits improve the score

The project states that the first live Sol bundle is `PARTIAL`, not a completed
case. It still does not prove provider authenticity, semantic truth, a measured
Sentinel-Ensemble win, full multi-image scheduling, privileged Docker mount parity, external
anchoring, or an authentic `COMPLETE` vNext case. That restraint makes the
claims that **are** checkable more credible.

## 7. Three-minute judge demo

| Time | Show | Narration |
|---:|---|---|
| 0:00–0:20 | Evidence folder | “Autonomous forensic agents are easy to demo and hard to trust. Unchained separates strategy from evidence authority.” |
| 0:20–0:40 | `doctor` + `profile --json` | Highlight route, SHA-256, readiness, tools, capability label, and zero model calls. |
| 0:40–1:10 | Opening audit/progress | Show GPT-5.6 selecting 1–6 calls, all-or-none validation, concurrent starts, and evidence IDs instead of local paths. |
| 1:10–1:35 | One adaptive transition | Show `PLAN -> one ACT -> OBSERVE -> UPDATE` and the bounded stateless request. |
| 1:35–2:00 | Span + review | Show artifact digest, exact byte-located quote, investigator proposal, and a reviewer preserve/downgrade. A real downgrade is the strongest visual. |
| 2:00–2:30 | Strict verify | Run `--require-complete --require-live-gpt56`; explain reconstruction, not just hash checking. |
| 2:30–2:50 | Static viewer | Show inventory, custody, receipts, findings, status transitions, citations, and limitations. |
| 2:50–3:00 | Close | “GPT-5.6 decides where to look; deterministic code proves what actually happened inside the investigation.” |

Use only an authentic retained bundle. A replay is fine when visibly labeled as
a replay of that authentic bundle. Never present a synthetic fixture as the
primary evidence run.

## 8. Frozen benchmark contract

Freeze the exact code SHA, prompts, model alias/snapshot, typed schemas, eligible
tool catalog, caps, retries, prices, evidence digest, reference facts, evaluator,
metric definitions, and run-selection rule before measurement.

| Metric | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| End-to-end wall time | Direct speed result |
| Time to first useful observation | Perceived responsiveness |
| Model request count | Orchestration overhead |
| Forensic tool-call count | Investigation efficiency |
| Input and output tokens | Context/generation efficiency |
| Estimated and provider-recorded cost | Practical operating cost |
| Proposed/correct/unsupported findings | Utility and hallucination burden |
| Precision, recall, F1 | Frozen semantic quality |
| Severity correctness | Triage usefulness |
| Exact citation resolution | Evidence integrity |
| Custody result | Evidence preservation |
| Strict verifier result | Protocol correctness |
| Human review time | User friendliness |

Use multiple retained runs; report median and spread. Preserve every valid
post-freeze run and preregister any selection rule. Do not cherry-pick the
fastest or best-looking result.

The desired headline shape is:

```text
same evidence
same available forensic tools
X% fewer input tokens
Y% lower median wall time
equal or better frozen-reference F1
100% exact citation resolution
100% custody and strict-verifier pass rate
```

Do not fill in `X`, `Y`, or any semantic win until measured.

## 9. Docker and cheap-model preflight

### What the container proves now

- Linux/AMD64 CPython 3.11 packaging and dependency resolution;
- a final runtime that installs from pre-resolved wheels with no Git;
- a non-root CLI under read-only/capability-free Compose policy;
- offline help, doctor behavior, evidence profiling, public IDs, and custody;
- raw Volatility/Sleuth Kit substrate availability;
- the mocked one-request Luna typed-tool contract;
- a second-reviewer-attested (project-affiliated) live Luna connectivity result, with the raw-receipt
  retention limitation stated explicitly.

Separately, the native Windows run now proves a recorded live Sol opening, six
successful typed Volatility executions on real memory, deterministic cap
enforcement, matching recorded custody, and a locally `VALID` retained
`PARTIAL` bundle.

### What it does not prove

- bundle-derived cryptographic proof of the Luna response, because its raw JSON
  receipt was not supplied;
- a complete Sol investigation lifecycle;
- live findings, fresh review, or a complete report lifecycle;
- mounted E01/FUSE/loop/device analysis;
- equivalent performance on Docker Desktop binds;
- a Linux dependency lock or pinned final base-image digest;
- external proof of the OCI revision/digest.

### Offline acceptance commands

```powershell
docker build --target test -t sentinel-unchained:test .
docker build --target runtime -t sentinel-unchained:local .
docker compose run --rm offline --help
docker compose run --rm offline profile /evidence --json
```

### Authentic cheap canary command

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY_FILE = "C:\Secure\openai_api_key"
docker compose --profile live run --rm live-smoke
```

The canary is one Luna Responses request with a forced strict function call,
low reasoning/verbosity, 128 output tokens maximum, `store=false`, no evidence,
and no proof bundle. It must return provider model, response/request IDs, valid
usage, and the exact fixed tool arguments.

OpenAI's current model guidance says the `gpt-5.6` alias routes to Sol, Terra
offers strong performance at a lower price, and Luna targets efficient
high-volume work. The canary therefore uses Luna, while the audited forensic
run remains Sol-only because its phase options, price table, and strict proof
policy are explicitly Sol-bound. See the official
[latest-model guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model)
and [pricing page](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing).

### Safe container boundary

The default uses non-root UID/GID 10001, read-only root and evidence, all
capabilities dropped, `no-new-privileges`, bounded PIDs, Tini, tmpfs scratch,
no Docker socket, no host PID, and no privileged mode. Offline has no network;
live-smoke has egress by necessity. The API key is a mounted Compose secret, not
an image layer or ordinary container environment value.

Filesystem mounting is intentionally absent. Enabling loop devices, FUSE,
device mapper, or `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` would weaken the isolation story. Use raw
Sleuth Kit operations or a deliberately configured native forensic host. Never
add `--privileged` merely to make a demo pass.

## 11. Honest limitations and forbidden claims

Do not claim any of the following yet:

- “GPT-5.6 completed the authentic case.”
- “The Luna projection is a raw or bundle-derived provider receipt.”
- “The capped Sol run exercised findings serialization, fresh review, or a
  complete report lifecycle.”
- “Unchained is faster/cheaper/more accurate than Sentinel-Ensemble.”
- “The offline verifier authenticates OpenAI.”
- “The reviewer is independent ground truth.”
- “The local cost estimate is the provider invoice.”
- “The Docker image supports every evidence route on any OS.”
- “Read-only process policy is a complete OS sandbox.”
- “SHA-256 custody defeats privileged concurrent path replacement.”
- “A local hash chain is externally immutable or timestamped.”
- “Exact citation presence proves the forensic interpretation.”

Additional engineering limits:

1. Same-class multi-image cases fail closed instead of scheduling all images.
2. Heavy opening tools are bounded but not resource-class scheduled.
3. Per-call worker startup remains measurable overhead.
4. Docker safe mode does not mount E01/NTFS/APFS filesystems.
5. A Linux/AMD64 lock and final base-image digest remain freeze tasks.
6. Docker Desktop/OneDrive binds can distort performance.
7. Authentic viewer visual QA remains pending.

## 12. Fastest path to a credible submission

1. **Publish the sanitized receipt projections.** Keep the Luna attestation and
   bundle-derived Sol projection visibly distinct; never publish raw evidence
   output or credentials.
2. **Freeze the complete experiment.** Bind code SHA, prompt bundle, Sol alias/snapshot,
   tool catalog/schemas, caps, retry policy, price table, evidence hash, scoring
   facts, run-selection rule, renderer/viewer policy, and model-view ceilings.
3. **Run a harmless complete Sol lifecycle.** Exercise opening, tool call,
   adaptive turn, typed `DONE`, serializer, reviewer, report, custody, strict
   verify, and viewer before spending the `COMPLETE` primary evidence run.
4. **Run and retain the authentic frozen `COMPLETE` case.** Preserve all audit entries,
   full tool outputs, provider metadata, usage, local estimates, report, viewer,
   manifest, checksum, verifier output, and post-run custody receipt.
5. **Run the same-evidence competitive comparison.** Match evidence, tool eligibility,
   caps, and scoring as closely as architectures allow; disclose differences.
6. **Score semantics separately.** The proof verifier cannot establish factual
   correctness. Use a frozen, disclosed evaluator for precision/recall/F1,
   severity, unsupported claims, and evidence relevance.
7. **Complete visual QA.** Chrome/Edge, Firefox, narrow width, offline, long
   hashes/paths/tables, Unicode, print, and empty states.
8. **Record the three-minute demo.** Show the authentic retained bundle and
   disclose any replay.
9. **Publish judge links.** Default `main`, judge quickstart, authentic viewer,
   checksum/verifier result, benchmark, video, and submission page.

## 13. Copy-ready winning language

### One line

> GPT-5.6 decides where to look; deterministic code proves what actually
> happened inside the investigation.

### Trust-boundary line

> The model chooses strategy. Code owns evidence, execution, caps, citations,
> custody, and the authoritative report.

### Full closing line

> Unchained is not an LLM pretending to be evidence. It is GPT-5.6 directing a
> bounded investigation whose actions, citations, custody, and final report can
> be checked independently.

### Answer to “why not just use an ensemble?”

> More agents can create more opinions. Unchained spends model intelligence on
> strategy and interpretation, then uses deterministic receipts and a monotonic
> fresh review to make the result smaller, faster to inspect, and harder to
> overstate.

### Answer to “does the verifier prove the finding is true?”

> No. It proves the declared controller lifecycle, tool/output binding, exact
> citation support, report/viewer reconstruction, usage, and custody within the
> local trust boundary. Semantic correctness is measured separately and remains
> a human responsibility.

## Bottom line

vNext is materially stronger than both reviewed starting points in OpenAI-native
orchestration, six-way opening concurrency, bounded stateless context, typed
execution, exact evidence grounding, monotonic review, deterministic report
authority, offline proof, CLI clarity, Docker preflight, and judge-facing UX.

The engineering now has its first authentic recorded Sol opening/tool bundle
and a second-reviewer-attested (project-affiliated) Luna connectivity result. The remaining
difference between an excellent prototype and a hackathon winner is the full
retained evidence chain: freeze it, run one authentic `COMPLETE` Sol lifecycle,
benchmark it fairly, score it against frozen facts, and show that complete
verified bundle in a tight three-minute story.
